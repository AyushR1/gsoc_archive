# 📄 GSoC Proposals - EvalAI Selection

This repository contains my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) proposal PDFs that led to my selection for the **EvalAI** project. I'm sharing these documents to help future applicants understand what a successful proposal can look like.

## 🚀 About the Project

* **Organization**: [EvalAI](https://eval.ai/)
* **Program**: Google Summer of Code (GSoC)
* **Year**: 2023
* **Proposal Status**: Selected 🎉 (EIO PROJECT)

## 📚 Contents

This repo includes:

* ✅ Final submitted proposals
* 🗒️ Any additional documentation or notes that supported the proposal process

## 💡 Why Share This?

I benefited from reading past GSoC proposals, and this is my way of giving back. These documents may help you:

* Understand how to structure a GSoC proposal
* Learn how to align your proposal with the organization's goals
* Get a sense of the level of detail expected by mentors
